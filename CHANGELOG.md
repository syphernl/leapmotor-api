### Changed
- **Breaking**: `VehicleStatus.is_parked` is now complementary to `is_driving` — uses ignition + gear logic (APK-aligned) instead of speed-based. Falls back to speed when ignition/gear data is unavailable
- `VehicleStatus.is_driving` now returns explicit `False` (instead of falsy `None`/`0`) when ignition or gear indicate not driving
- Added `HvacDirection` IntEnum for `ac_cooling_and_heating` field: `WIND=0`, `COLD=1`, `HOT=2`
- Added `HvacMode` IntEnum for `climate_mode` field (signal `$3713`): `OFF=0`, `FAST_COOL=1`, `FAST_HEAT=3`

- Added signal `1941` → `acAirVolume` mapping: HVAC fan speed (1–7) now populated on C10/B10 signal-based responses
- Added legacy HVAC air direction derivation: when signal `3713` is absent, combines cooling flap (`1940`) and heating flap (`1949`) signals into `acCoolingAndHeating` (0=wind, 1=cold, 2=hot) following the APK truth table
- Added `VehicleStatus.is_driving` convenience property: `True` when ignition ON3 is active and gear is in DRIVE or REVERSE (based on `bcmKeyPositionOn3` and `gearStatus`)
- Added `BatteryStatus.ac_input_slow_charge` field: AC slow charge input status (signal `47` / `acInputSlowCharge`)
- Added `BoolStatus` IntEnum (`OFF=0`, `ON=1`) for generic boolean signals from the API
- Added `BatteryStatus.is_charge_fast_gun_insert` computed property: `True` when the DC fast charge gun is inserted (`dcInputFastCharge == BoolStatus.ON`)
- Added `BatteryStatus.is_charge_slow_gun_insert` computed property: `True` when the AC slow charge gun is inserted (`acInputSlowCharge == BoolStatus.ON`)
- Added `GearStatus` IntEnum for gear position codes (`PARK=0`, `DRIVE=1`, `NEUTRAL=2`, `REVERSE=3`)
- Added `VehicleAbility`, `VehicleRight`, and `ModuleRight` IntEnum classes for typed vehicle permissions, replacing raw strings/lists
- `Vehicle.rights`, `Vehicle.abilities`, and `Vehicle.module_rights` are now typed lists of enum members (parsed from API strings) with empty-list defaults
- Added `Vehicle.has_ability()`, `Vehicle.has_right()`, and `Vehicle.has_module_right()` convenience methods accepting both enum members and raw ints
- Unknown permission codes from the API are handled gracefully via `_missing_()` (e.g. ability 61 → `UNKNOWN_61`) instead of raising errors
- Each enum member has a `.description` property with a human-readable label
- Added `required_right` field to `RemoteActionSpec` linking each remote command to its required `VehicleRight`
- Remote commands now log a warning when the vehicle's rights may not include the required permission (soft check — the server remains the authority)
- Added `LeapmotorPermissionError` exception class for consumers wanting strict permission enforcement
- Added `SeatComfortStatus` sub-object: driver/passenger seat heating and ventilation levels, steering wheel heating and remaining minutes
- Added `SecurityStatus` sub-object: vehicle security active, sentry mode, mirror heating (left/right), roof/skylight opening
- Added new fields to `BatteryStatus`: `precise_soc`, `min_battery_temp`, `battery_thermal_request`, `charge_completed`
- Added `ChargePlan` sub-object inside `BatteryStatus` (`battery.charge_plan`) grouping charge schedule fields: `soc_setting`, `time_setting`, `enabled`, `start`, `end`, `cycles`, `circulation`, `recharge`
- Added new fields to `DrivingStatus`: `vehicle_state`, `speed_limit`, `speed_limit_unit`, `speed_limit_active`, `live_remaining_range`, `max_range`, `range_mode`
- Added new fields to `ClimateStatus`: `ac_setting_right`, `interior_temp`, `recirculation_mode`, `windshield_defrost`, `rear_window_heating`, `climate_mode`, `rapid_cooling`, `rapid_heating`
- Added `bcm_key_position_on2` to `IgnitionStatus`
- Added `config.3` charge plan mapping for C10/B10: charge limit and scheduling fields are now populated from the `config` section (including `recharge`)
- Added GPS fallback using alternative coordinates (signals `2190`/`2191`) when primary GPS signals are absent
- Added 30+ new signal IDs to `_SIGNAL_TO_NAMED` covering all new fields
- Added documentation for api (`docs/api.md`) and vehicles (`docs/vehicles.md`)
- Added `RemoteActionCtlChargePlan` typed dataclass for charge plan/schedule commands (`cmd_id=190`) with fields: `charge_enable`, `chargesoc`, `circulation`, `cycles`, `endtime`, `recharge`, `starttime`
- Added `REMOTE_CTL_CHARGE_LIMIT` constant and corresponding entry in `REMOTE_ACTION_SPECS`

- Added `REMOTE_CTL_SEND_DESTINATION` constant and corresponding entry in `REMOTE_ACTION_SPECS`
- Added `requires_pin` field to `RemoteActionSpec` (default `True`); pin-less commands like `send_destination` set it to `False`
- Added typed energy consumption models: `WeeklyConsumption`, `ConsumptionRank`, `ConsumptionWeeklyRank`, and `ConsumptionLastWeekBreakdown` (with `total_ec` computed property)
- Added `get_consumption_weekly_rank()` and `get_consumption_last_week_breakdown()` methods for retrieving energy consumption statistics from the cloud
- Added `unlock_charger()` remote command (`cmd_id=192`) for unlocking the charging connector before unplugging, with `RemoteActionCtlUnlockCharger` dataclass, `REMOTE_CTL_UNLOCK_CHARGER` constant, `VehicleRight.UNLOCK_CHARGER` (192), and `ChargerOperation` enum
- Added `get_charging_daily_detail()` method for fetching paginated charging session history, with typed models: `ChargeType` enum (`AC`/`DC`), `ChargeRecord` dataclass (with `start_datetime`, `end_datetime`, `duration_seconds`, `is_fast_charge` properties), and `ChargeDailyDetailPage` paginated response; accepts `datetime.date` for `start_time`/`end_time` and a `timezone` parameter (default `"GMT+00:00"`)

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `RemoteActionCtlClimate.windlevel` changed from `str` (default `"4"`) to `int` (default `4`) with validation constraining the value to the range 1–7; the JSON payload still serialises the value as a string for API compatibility
- **Breaking:** `ChargeState` enum members renamed: `NOT_CONNECTED` → `NOT_CHARGING`, `AC_CONNECTED` → `CHARGING`, `DC_CONNECTED` → `FINISH`; added new members: `ERROR=3`, `SETTING=4`, `REGENING=5`, `PAUSE=6`
- **Breaking:** `BatteryStatus.is_charging` now uses `charge_state == ChargeState.CHARGING` instead of `charging_power_kw is not None and charge_remain_time`
- **Breaking:** `VehicleStatus.is_plugged` now returns `True` even while actively charging (previously required `not is_charging`); checks fast gun first, then falls back to `charge_state` when `ac_input_slow_charge` is unavailable (T03), otherwise uses slow gun signal; all paths require `is_parked`
- **Breaking:** `VehicleStatus.is_charging` simplified to `charge_state == ChargeState.CHARGING and is_parked and is_charging`
- **Breaking:** `VehicleStatus.is_regening` now checks `charge_state == ChargeState.REGENING` instead of combining `battery.is_charging` with `charge_state == NOT_CHARGING`
- **Breaking:** `DrivingStatus.gear_status` changed from `int | None` to `GearStatus | None`
- **Breaking:** `Vehicle.rights` changed from `str | None` to `list[VehicleRight]` (was a comma-separated string like `"110,120,230"`)
- **Breaking:** `Vehicle.abilities` changed from `list[str] | None` to `list[VehicleAbility]` (was a list of numeric strings like `["1", "10", "36"]`)
- **Breaking:** `Vehicle.module_rights` changed from `str | None` to `list[ModuleRight]` (was a comma-separated string like `"100,200,300,400"`)
- `DrivingStatus.is_parked` now falls back to `vehicle_state` signal when `speed` is unavailable (improves C10/B10 reliability)
- `set_charge_limit` now reads charging plan data from the typed `VehicleStatus.battery.charge_plan` sub-object instead of navigating raw API dicts
- `set_charge_limit` now delegates to `_remote_control()` for consistent token/PIN/permission checks instead of calling `_remote_control_raw()` directly
- `send_destination` now uses `RemoteActionCtlSendDestination` and delegates to `_remote_control()` for consistent permission checks instead of inline JSON and `_remote_control_without_pin_raw()`
- `_remote_control()` now routes pin-less commands (where `spec.requires_pin` is `False`) to `_remote_control_without_pin_raw()` automatically
- **Breaking:** `BatteryStatus` charge schedule fields (`charge_soc_setting`, `charge_time_setting`, `charge_schedule_enabled`, `charge_schedule_start`, `charge_schedule_end`, `charge_schedule_cycles`, `charge_schedule_circulation`, `charge_schedule_recharge`) moved into `BatteryStatus.charge_plan` (`ChargePlan` sub-object) — e.g. `battery.charge_schedule_start` → `battery.charge_plan.start`
- **Breaking:** `RemoteActionCtlChargeLimit` renamed to `RemoteActionCtlChargePlan`
- All crypto header builders (`build_consumption_weekly_rank_headers`, `build_consumption_last_week_headers`) now return `ApiRequestHeaders` instead of raw `dict[str, str]`

### Removed
- **Breaking:** Removed `fetch_data()` from `LeapmotorApiClient` and `AsyncLeapmotorApiClient` — was a debug-only aggregation method; use `get_vehicle_list()` + `get_vehicle_status()` instead
- **Breaking:** Removed `normalize_vehicle()` — debug-only flattening helper superseded by typed `VehicleStatus` model with raw data included
- **Breaking:** Removed `_fetch_authenticated_data()` internal method — debug-only helper no longer needed

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- Fixed vehicle status endpoint returning HTTP 404 for B10 vehicles: the international backend reports `carType=B10` in the vehicle list but the status endpoint is shared with C10 (`/status/get/c10`)

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- Added debug logging to `_post` (logs HTTP status and response body for all API calls), `_post_binary` (logs HTTP status and response size), and `_poll_remote_control_result` (logs each polling iteration) for better troubleshooting

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- Fixed `Vehicle.seat_layout` and `Vehicle.rudder` fields: convert to `str` in `from_dict()` to handle B10 vehicles returning integer values from the API

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- Fixed `BatteryStatus.is_charging` returning `True` when vehicle is off/not charging because `charge_remain_time` was `0` instead of `None`; now requires a truthy (non-zero) value

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- Automatic token refresh: all public API methods now transparently handle expired tokens by calling `/acct/v1/token/refresh` before falling back to a full re-login
- Added `token_refresh()` method to both `LeapmotorApiClient` and `AsyncLeapmotorApiClient` for explicit token renewal
- Stored `refresh_token` from login response for use by the refresh flow
- Added `VehicleStatus.is_plugged` property: returns `True` when a charger is connected but charging has not started yet
- Charging image layers: `is_plugged` state shows `carpic_charge_open` + `carpic_charge1` (static plug indicator); active charging starts from frame 2

### Changed
- Refactored `RemoteActionSpec` into typed subclasses (`RemoteActionCtlLock`, `RemoteActionCtlTrunk`, `RemoteActionCtlFindCar`, `RemoteActionCtlSunshade`, `RemoteActionCtlBatteryPreheat`, `RemoteActionCtlWindows`, `RemoteActionCtlClimate`) with explicit parameters per command
- Added `StrEnum` value types for type-safe command parameters: `LockValue`, `ToggleValue`, `SunshadeValue`, `WindowsValue`, `BatteryPreheatValue`, `ClimateCircle`, `ClimateMode`, `ClimateOperate`, `ClimatePosition`, `ClimateWindshield`
- `RemoteActionCtlSunshade` and `RemoteActionCtlWindows` now validate value ranges (0-10 and 0-100 respectively) at construction time
- Charging animation now excludes frame 1 and uses frames 2–15

### Fixed
- Fixed `Vehicle.from_dict` mapping: `userNickname` → `nickName` and `rights` → `rightList` to match actual API response keys
- Correct `is_charging` assignment in image layer composition

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- Added `Message` and `MessageList` models for notification messages
- Added `get_message_list(page_no, page_size)` method to retrieve paginated messages
- Added `get_unread_message_count()` method to get the number of unread messages
- Added async variants of message methods to `AsyncLeapmotorApiClient`
- Added `body_params` support to `build_signed_headers` for endpoints that include body parameters in the HMAC signature
- Updated example usage script to display messages

### Changed
- Remote control methods (`open_windows`, `close_windows`, `windows`, `control_sunshade`, `open_sunshade`, `close_sunshade`) now accept an optional `value` parameter to control intensity/position
- AC methods (`ac_switch`, `quick_cool`, `quick_heat`, `windshield_defrost`) now accept an optional `params` dict to override default climate settings (temperature, wind level, etc.)
- Internal `_remote_control` accepts optional `cmd_content` override for custom payloads

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Added Enum for `ChargeState` and mapped raw integer values to enum members (e.g., `NOT_CONNECTED`, `AC_CONNECTED`, `DC_CONNECTED`)
- Added discharging power and `is_discharging` properties to battery status model
- Added `from_dict` class method to `BatteryStatus` for mapping raw API response into structured model
- Added regenerative braking status to vehicle status model (`is_regening` property) that indicates when the vehicle is regeneratively braking (i.e., driving with battery charging)
- Added `certs` folder for storing certificate files used for API communication
- Added `email`, `plate_number`, `vehicle_nickname`, `mobile_number`, `out_color`, `share_time`, `expire_time`, `duration_type`, `seat_layout`, `rudder` and `allocation_code` fields to `Vehicle` model based on API response data
- Added `raw` property to `Vehicle` model for storing original API response data for forward-compatibility and debugging
- Added `from_dict` class method to `Vehicle` model for mapping raw API response into structured model
- Added example usage script (`examples/usage.py`) that demonstrates how to use the `LeapmotorApiClient` to connect to the API, retrieve vehicle status, and display it in a human-readable format
- Added `pre-commit` dependency in `pyproject.toml` for managing git hooks and ensuring code quality before commits

### Changed
- Updated `BatteryStatus` to use `ChargeState` enum instead of raw integers
- Updated `BatteryStatus` logic for charging and discharging states
- Renamed `nickname` field in `Vehicle` model to `vehicle_nickname` for clarity
- Refactored `get_vehicle_status` method into `LeapmotorApiClient` to utilize new `VehicleStatus.from_dict` for parsing API response into structured model

### Removed
- Battery fields that map raw api into `BatteryStatus` model (e.g., `soc` and `chargeState` properties that were previously calculated based on raw api values)


## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Initial release with login, vehicle status, and remote commands
- Async client support
- AES encryption utilities for API communication
