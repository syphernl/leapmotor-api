## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added `SeatComfortStatus` sub-object: driver/passenger seat heating and ventilation levels, steering wheel heating and remaining minutes
- Added `SecurityStatus` sub-object: vehicle security active, sentry mode, mirror heating (left/right), roof/skylight opening
- Added new fields to `BatteryStatus`: `precise_soc`, `min_battery_temp`, `battery_thermal_request`, `charge_completed`, `charge_schedule_enabled`, `charge_schedule_start`, `charge_schedule_end`, `charge_schedule_cycles`, `charge_schedule_circulation`
- Added new fields to `DrivingStatus`: `vehicle_state`, `driving_state`, `speed_limit`, `speed_limit_unit`, `speed_limit_active`, `live_remaining_range`, `max_range`, `range_mode`
- Added new fields to `ClimateStatus`: `ac_setting_right`, `interior_temp`, `recirculation_mode`, `windshield_defrost`, `rear_window_heating`, `climate_mode`, `rapid_cooling`, `rapid_heating`
- Added `bcm_key_position_on2` to `IgnitionStatus`
- Added `config.3` charge plan mapping for C10/B10: charge limit and scheduling fields are now populated from the `config` section
- Added GPS fallback using alternative coordinates (signals `2190`/`2191`) when primary GPS signals are absent
- Added 30+ new signal IDs to `_SIGNAL_TO_NAMED` covering all new fields
- Added documentation for api (`docs/api.md`) and vehicles (`docs/vehicles.md`)

### Changed
- `DrivingStatus.is_parked` now falls back to `vehicle_state` and `driving_state` signals when `speed` is unavailable (improves C10/B10 reliability)

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- Fixed vehicle status endpoint returning HTTP 404 for B10 vehicles: the international backend reports `carType=B10` in the vehicle list but the status endpoint is shared with C10 (`/status/get/c10`)

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- Added debug logging to `_post` (logs HTTP status and response body for all API calls), `_post_binary` (logs HTTP status and response size), and `_poll_remote_control_result` (logs each polling iteration) for better troubleshooting

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- Fixed `Vehicle.seat_layout` and `Vehicle.rudder` fields: convert to `str` in `from_dict()` to handle B10 vehicles returning integer values from the API

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- Fixed `BatteryStatus.is_charging` returning `True` when vehicle is off/not charging because `charge_remain_time` was `0` instead of `None`; now requires a truthy (non-zero) value

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- Automatic token refresh: all public API methods now transparently handle expired tokens by calling `/acct/v1/token/refresh` before falling back to a full re-login
- Added `token_refresh()` method to both `LeapmotorApiClient` and `AsyncLeapmotorApiClient` for explicit token renewal
- Stored `refresh_token` from login response for use by the refresh flow
- Added `VehicleStatus.is_plugged` property: returns `True` when a charger is connected but charging has not started yet
- Charging image layers: `is_plugged` state shows `carpic_charge_open` + `carpic_charge1` (static plug indicator); active charging starts from frame 2

### Changed
- Refactored `RemoteActionSpec` into typed subclasses (`RemoteActionCtlLock`, `RemoteActionCtlTrunk`, `RemoteActionCtlFindCar`, `RemoteActionCtlSunshade`, `RemoteActionCtlBatteryPreheat`, `RemoteActionCtlWindows`, `RemoteActionCtlClimate`) with explicit parameters per command
- Added `StrEnum` value types for type-safe command parameters: `LockValue`, `ToggleValue`, `SunshadeValue`, `WindowsValue`, `BatteryPreheatValue`, `ClimateCircle`, `ClimateMode`, `ClimateOperate`, `ClimatePosition`, `ClimateWindshield`
- `RemoteActionCtlSunshade` and `RemoteActionCtlWindows` now validate value ranges (0-10 and 0-100 respectively) at construction time
- Charging animation now excludes frame 1 and uses frames 2–15

### Fixed
- Fixed `Vehicle.from_dict` mapping: `userNickname` → `nickName` and `rights` → `rightList` to match actual API response keys
- Correct `is_charging` assignment in image layer composition

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- Added `Message` and `MessageList` models for notification messages
- Added `get_message_list(page_no, page_size)` method to retrieve paginated messages
- Added `get_unread_message_count()` method to get the number of unread messages
- Added async variants of message methods to `AsyncLeapmotorApiClient`
- Added `body_params` support to `build_signed_headers` for endpoints that include body parameters in the HMAC signature
- Updated example usage script to display messages

### Changed
- Remote control methods (`open_windows`, `close_windows`, `windows`, `control_sunshade`, `open_sunshade`, `close_sunshade`) now accept an optional `value` parameter to control intensity/position
- AC methods (`ac_switch`, `quick_cool`, `quick_heat`, `windshield_defrost`) now accept an optional `params` dict to override default climate settings (temperature, wind level, etc.)
- Internal `_remote_control` accepts optional `cmd_content` override for custom payloads

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Added Enum for `ChargeState` and mapped raw integer values to enum members (e.g., `NOT_CONNECTED`, `AC_CONNECTED`, `DC_CONNECTED`)
- Added discharging power and `is_discharging` properties to battery status model
- Added `from_dict` class method to `BatteryStatus` for mapping raw API response into structured model
- Added regenerative braking status to vehicle status model (`is_regening` property) that indicates when the vehicle is regeneratively braking (i.e., driving with battery charging)
- Added `certs` folder for storing certificate files used for API communication
- Added `email`, `plate_number`, `vehicle_nickname`, `mobile_number`, `out_color`, `share_time`, `expire_time`, `duration_type`, `seat_layout`, `rudder` and `allocation_code` fields to `Vehicle` model based on API response data
- Added `raw` property to `Vehicle` model for storing original API response data for forward-compatibility and debugging
- Added `from_dict` class method to `Vehicle` model for mapping raw API response into structured model
- Added example usage script (`examples/usage.py`) that demonstrates how to use the `LeapmotorApiClient` to connect to the API, retrieve vehicle status, and display it in a human-readable format
- Added `pre-commit` dependency in `pyproject.toml` for managing git hooks and ensuring code quality before commits

### Changed
- Updated `BatteryStatus` to use `ChargeState` enum instead of raw integers
- Updated `BatteryStatus` logic for charging and discharging states
- Renamed `nickname` field in `Vehicle` model to `vehicle_nickname` for clarity
- Refactored `get_vehicle_status` method into `LeapmotorApiClient` to utilize new `VehicleStatus.from_dict` for parsing API response into structured model

### Removed
- Battery fields that map raw api into `BatteryStatus` model (e.g., `soc` and `chargeState` properties that were previously calculated based on raw api values)


## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Initial release with login, vehicle status, and remote commands
- Async client support
- AES encryption utilities for API communication
- Vehicle image generation
- Typed models for API responses
